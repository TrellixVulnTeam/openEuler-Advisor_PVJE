The only remaining consumers have been converted to\n  use the standard TMPDIR environment variable.  As a benefit, and because\n  Kyua forces the TMPDIR to live within the test case's work directory,\n  any stale files left behind by ATF will be automatically cleaned up.\n- Documented the environment variables recognized by each component in the\n  relevant manual pages.  This information was lost with the atf-config(1)\n  removal.\n- Added a new \"require.diskspace\" metadata property to test cases so that\n  they can specify the minimum amount of disk space required for the test\n  to run.\n- Renamed the atf-{c,c++,sh}-api(3) manual pages to atf-{c,c++,sh}(3) for\n  discoverability purposes.  Symbolic links are provided for the time\n  being to still make the old names visible.\n- Issue #5: Recommend the (expected, actual) idiom for calls to the test\n  macros in the manual pages.\n- Issue #7: Stopped catching unhandled exceptions in atf-c++ tests.  This\n  propagates the crash to the caller, which in turn allows it to obtain\n  proper debugging information.  In particular, Kyua should now be able to\n  extract a stacktrace pinpointing the problem.\n- Issue #8: Fixed atf-c/macros_test:use test failures spotted by the clang\n  that ships with FreeBSD 11.0-CURRENT.\n- Issue #12: Improved documentation of atf-sh(3) and atf-check(1) by better\n  explaining how they relate to each other.\n- Issue #14: Stopped setting 'set -e' in atf-sh.  This setting was\n  initially added as a way to enable a \"strict\" mode in the library and to\n  make test cases fail fast when they run unprotected commands.  However,\n  doing so in the library is surprising as the responsibility of enabling\n  'set -e' should be on the user's code.  Also, 'set -e' introduces\n  inconsistent behavior on subshells and users do not expect that.\n- Issue #15: Fixed atf_utils_{fork,wait} to support nested calls.\n- Issue #16: Fixed test failures (by removing a long-standing hack) on\n  systems that lack \\e support in printf(1).\n- Issue #19: Removed stale references to atf-config and atf-run.\n"

The code in this directory is standalone and\ndoes not depend on any internal details of atf-c++ any longer.\n- Various fixes and improvements to support running as part of the FreeBSD\n  test suite.\n- Project hosting moved from Google Code (as a subproject of Kyua) to\n  GitHub (as a first-class project).  The main reason for the change is\n  the suppression of binary downloads in Google Code on Jan 15th, 2014.\n  See https://github.com/jmmv/atf/\n- Removed builtin help from atf-sh(1) and atf-check(1) for simplicity\n  reasons.  In other words, their -h option is gone.\n- Moved the code of the deprecated tools into a 'tools' directory and\n  completely decoupled their code from the internals of atf-c++.  The\n  reason for this is to painlessly allow a third-party to maintain a\n  copy of these tools after we delete them because upcoming changes to\n  atf-c++ would break the stale tools.\n"

In order\n  to continue running tests, you should migrate to Kyua instead of enabling\n  the build of the deprecated tools.  The kyua-atf-compat package provides\n  transitional compatibility versions of atf-run and atf-report built on\n  top of Kyua.\n- Tweaked the ATF_TEST_CASE macro of atf-c++ so that the compiler can\n  detect defined but unused test cases.\n- PR bin/45859: Fixed some XSLT bugs that resulted in the tc-time and\n  tp-time XML tags leaking into the generated HTML file.  Also improved\n  the CSS file slightly to correct alignment and color issues with the\n  timestamps column.\n- Optimized atf-c++/macros.hpp so that GNU G++ consumes less memory during\n  compilation with GNU G++.\n- Flipped the default to building shared libraries for atf-c and atf-c++,\n  and started versioning them.  As a side-effect, this removes the\n  --enable-unstable-shared flag from configure that appears to not work any\n  more (under NetBSD).  Additionally, some distributions require the use of\n  shared libraries for proper dependency tracking (e.g. Fedora), so it is\n  better if we do the right versioning upstream.\n- Project hosting moved from an adhoc solution (custom web site and\n  Monotone repository) to Google Code (standard wiki and Git).  ATF now\n  lives in a subcomponent of the Kyua project.\n"

The previous release silenced stdin for any\n  processes spawned by atf, not only test programs, which caused breakage\n  in tests that pipe data through atf-check.\n- Performance improvements to atf-sh.\n- Enabled detection of unused parameters and variables in the code and\n  fixed all warnings.\n- Changed the behavior of \"developer mode\".  Compiler warnings are now\n  enabled unconditionally regardless of whether we are in developer mode or\n  not; developer mode is now only used to perform strict warning checks and\n  to enable assertions.  Additionally, developer mode is now only\n  automatically enabled when building from the repository, not for formal\n  releases.\n- Added new Autoconf M4 macros (ATF_ARG_WITH, ATF_CHECK_C and\n  ATF_CHECK_CXX) to provide a consistent way of defining a --with-arg flag\n  in configure scripts and detecting the presence of any of the ATF\n  bindings.  Note that ATF_CHECK_SH was already introduced in 0.14, but it\n  has now been modified to also honor --with-atf if instantiated.\n- Added timing support to atf-run / atf-report.\n- Added support for a 'require.memory' property, to specify the minimum\n  amount of physical memory needed by the test case to yield valid results.\n- PR bin/45690: Force an ISO-8859-1 encoding in the XML files generated by\n  atf-report so that invalid data in the output of test cases does not\n  mangle our report.\n"

From now on, ATF will change to\naccomodate the transition to this new codebase, but ATF will still continue\nto see development in the short/medium term.  Check out the project page at\nhttp://code.google.com/p/kyua/ for more details.\n\nThe changes in this release are:\n- Added support to run the tests with the Kyua runtime engine (kyua-cli), a\n  new package that aims to replace atf-run and atf-report.  The ATF tests\n  can be run with the new system by issuing a 'make installcheck-kyua' from\n  the top-level directory of the project (assuming the 'kyua' binary is\n  available during the configuration stage of ATF).\n- atf-run and atf-report are now in maintenance mode (but _not_ deprecated\n  yet!).  Kyua already implements a new, much more reliable runtime engine\n  that provides similar features to these tools.  That said, it is not\n  complete yet so all development efforts should go towards it.\n- If GDB is installed, atf-run dumps the stack trace of crashing test\n  programs in an attempt to aid debugging.  Contributed by Antti Kantee.\n- Reverted default timeout change in previous release and reset its value\n  to 5 minutes.  This was causing several issues, specially when running\n  the existing NetBSD test suite in qemu.\n- Fixed the 'match' output checker in atf-check to properly validate the\n  last line of a file even if it does not have a newline.\n- Added the ATF_REQUIRE_IN and ATF_REQUIRE_NOT_IN macros to atf-c++ to\n  check for the presence (or lack thereof) of an element in a collection.\n- PR bin/44176: Fixed a race condition in atf-run that would crash atf-run\n  when the cleanup of a test case triggered asynchronous modifications to\n  its work directory (e.g. killing a daemon process that cleans up a pid\n  file in the work directory).\n- PR bin/44301: Fixed the sample XSLT file to report bogus test programs\n  instead of just listing them as having 0 test cases.\n"

While this seemed like a good idea in\n  the first place to impose more control on what test cases can do, it\n  turns out to be bad.  First, use.fs=false prevents bogus test cases\n  from dumping core so after-the-fact debugging is harder.  Second,\n  supporting use.fs adds a lot of unnecessary complexity.  atf-run will\n  now ignore any value provided to use.fs and will allow test cases to\n  freely access the file system if they wish to.\n- Added the atf_tc_get_config_var_as_{bool,long}{,_wd} functions to the atf-c\n  library.  The 'text' module became private in 0.11 but was being used\n  externally to simplify the parsing of configuration variables.\n- Made atf-run recognize the 'unprivileged-user' configuration variable\n  and automatically drop root privileges when a test case sets\n  require.user=unprivileged.  Note that this is, by no means, done for\n  security purposes; this is just for user convenience; tests should, in\n  general, not be blindly run as root in the first place.\n"

The header files for the\n  internal modules are not installed any more.\n- Made the atf-check tool private.  It is only required by atf-sh and being\n  public has the danger of causing confusion.  Also, making it private\n  simplifies the public API of atf.\n- Changed atf-sh to enable per-command error checking (set -e) by default.\n  This catches many cases in which a test case is broken but it is not\n  reported as such because execution continues.\n- Fixed the XSTL and CSS stylesheets to support expected failures.\n"

        "body": "# Changes in version 0.10\n\nExperimental version released on July 2nd, 2010.\n\nMiscellaneous features\n- Added expected failures support to test cases and atf-run.  These\n  include, for example, expected clean exits, expected reception of fatal\n  signals, expected timeouts and expected errors in condition checks.\n  These statuses can be used to denote test cases that are known to fail\n  due to a bug in the code they are testing.  atf-report reports these\n  tests separately but they do not count towards the failed test cases\n  amount.\n- Added the ATF_CHECK_ERRNO and ATF_REQUIRE_ERRNO to the C library to\n  allow easy checking of call failures that update errno.\n- Added the has.cleanup meta-data property to test caes that specifies\n  whether the test case has a cleanup routine or not; its value is\n  automatically set.  This property is read by atf-run to know if it has to\n  run the cleanup routine; skipping this run for every test case\n  significantly speeds up the run time of test suites.\n- Reversed the order of the ATF_CHECK_THROW macro in the C++ binding to\n  take the expected exception as the first argument and the statement to\n  execute as the second argument.\n\nChanges in atf-check\n- Changed atf-check to support negating the status and output checks by\n  prefixing them with not- and added support to specify multiple checkers\n  for stdout and stderr, not only one.\n- Added the match output checker to atf-check to look for regular\n  expressions in the stdout and stderr of commands.\n- Modified the exit checks in atf-check to support checking for the\n  reception of signals.\n\nCode simplifications and cleanups\n- Removed usage messages from test programs to simplify the\n  implementation of every binding by a significant amount.  They just now\n  refer the user to the appropriate manual page and do not attempt to wrap\n  lines on terminal boundaries.  Test programs are not supposed to be run\n  by users directly so this minor interface regression is not important.\n- Removed the atf-format internal utility, which is unused after the\n  change documented above.\n- Removed the atf-cleanup internal utility.  It has been unused since the\n  test case isolation was moved to atf-run in 0.8\n- Splitted the Makefile.am into smaller files for easier maintenance and\n  dropped the use of M4.  Only affects users building from the repository\n  sources.\n- Intermixed tests with the source files in the source tree to provide\n  them more visibility and easier access.  The tests directory is gone from\n  the source tree and tests are now suffixed by _test, not prefixed by t_.\n- Simplifications to the atf-c library: removed the io, tcr and ui\n  modules as they had become unnecessary after all simplifications\n  introduced since the 0.8 release.\n- Removed the application/X-atf-tcr format introduced in 0.8 release.\n  Tests now print a much simplified format that is easy to parse and nicer\n  to read by end users.  As a side effect, the default for test cases is\n  now to print their results to stdout unless otherwise stated by providing\n  the -r flag.\n- Removed XML distribution documents and replaced them with plain-text\n  documents.  They provided little value and introduced a lot of complexity\n  to the build system.\n- Simplified the output of atf-version by not attempting to print a\n  revision number when building form a distfile.  Makes the build system\n  easier to maintain.\n"

        "body": "# Changes in version 0.9\n\nExperimental version released on June 3rd, 2010.\n- Added atf-sh, an interpreter to process test programs written using\n  the shell API.  This is not really a shell interpreter by itself though:\n  it is just a wrapper around the system shell that eases the loading of\n  the necessary ATF libraries.\n- Removed atf-compile in favour of atf-sh.\n- Added the use.fs metadata property to test case, which is used to\n  specify which test cases require file system access.  This is to\n  highlight dependencies on external resources more clearly and to speed up\n  the execution of test suites by skipping the creation of many unnecessary\n  work directories.\n- Fixed test programs to get a sane default value for their source\n  directory.  This means that it should not be necessary any more to pass\n  -s when running test programs that do not live in the current directory.\n- Defining test case headers became optional.  This is trivial to achieve\n  in shell-based tests but a bit ugly in C and C++.  In C, use the new\n  ATF_TC_WITHOUT_HEAD macro to define the test case, and in C++ use\n  ATF_TEST_CASE_WITHOUT_HEAD.\n"

        "body": "# Changes in version 0.8\n\nExperimental version released on May 7th, 2010.\n- Test programs no longer run several test cases in a row.  The execution\n  of a test program now requires a test case name, and that single test\n  case is executed.  To execute several test cases, use the atf-run utility\n  as usual.\n- Test programs no longer fork a subprocess to isolate the execution of\n  test cases.  They run the test case code in-process, and a crash of the\n  test case will result in a crash of the test program.  This is to ease\n  debugging of faulty test cases.\n- Test programs no longer isolate their test cases.  This means that they\n  will not create temporary directories nor sanitize the environment any\n  more.  Yes: running a test case that depends on system state by hand will\n  most likely yield different results depending on where (machine,\n  directory, user environment, etc.) it is run.  Isolation has been moved\n  to atf-run.\n- Test programs no longer print a cryptic format (application/X-atf-tcs)\n  on a special file channel.  They can now print whatever they want on the\n  screen.  Because test programs can now only run one test case every time,\n  providing controlled output is not necessary any more.\n- Test programs no longer write their status into a special file\n  descriptor.  Instead, they create a file with the results, which is later\n  parsed by atf-run.  This changes the semantics of the -r flag.\n- atf-run has been adjusted to perform the test case isolation.  As a\n  result, there is now a single canonical place that implements the\n  isolation of test caes.  In previous releases, the three language\n  bindings (C, C++ and shell) had to be kept in sync with each other (read:\n  not a nice thing to do at all).  As a side effect of this change, writing\n  bindings for other languages will be much, much easier from now on.\n- atf-run forks test programs on a test case basis, instead of on a test\n  program basis as it did before.  This is to provide the test case\n  isolation that was before implemented by the test programs themselves.\n- Removed the atf-exec tool.  This was used to implement test case\n  isolation in atf-sh, but it is now unnecessary.\n- It is now optional to define the descr meta-data property.  It has been\n  proven to be mostly useless, because test cases often carry a descriptive\n  name of their own.\n"

Same behavior as before, but\n  noticeably faster.\n- atf-exec's -g option and atf-killpg are gone due to the previous\n  change.\n- Added the atf-check(1) tool, a program that executes a given command\n  and checks its exit code against a known value and allows the management\n  of stdout and stderr in multiple ways.  This replaces the previous\n  atf_check function in the atf-sh library and exposes this functionality\n  to both atf-c and atf-c++.\n- Added the ATF_REQUIRE family of macros to the C interface.  These help\n  in checking for fatal test conditions.  The old ATF_CHECK macros now\n  perform non-fatal checks only.  I.e. by using ATF_CHECK, the test case\n  can now continue its execution and the failures will not be reported\n  until the end of the whole run.\n- Extended the amount of ATF_CHECK_\\* C macros with new ones to provide\n  more features to the developer.  These also have their corresponding\n  counterparts in the ATF_REQUIRE_\\* family.  The new macros (listing the\n  suffixes only) are: _EQ (replaces _EQUAL), _EQ_MSG, _STREQ and\n  _STREQ_MSG.\n"

This was possible in prior\n  releases by defining the workdir configuration variable (-v workdir=...),\n  but was a conceptually incorrect mechanism.\n- Test programs now preserve the execution order of test cases when they\n  are given in the command line.

Of special interest, full support for\n  SunOS (Solaris Express Developer Edition 2007/09) using the Sun Studio 12\n  C++ compiler.\n- Fixed a serious bug that prevented atf-run(1) from working at all\n  under Fedora 8 x86_64.

The user\n  and system administrator are allowed to tune this feature by means of\n  hooks.\n- Removed the test cases' 'isolated' property.  This was intended to\n  avoid touching the file system at all when running the related test case,\n  but this has not been true for a long while: some control files are\n  unconditionally required for several purposes, and we cannot easily get\n  rid of them.  This way we remove several critical and delicate pieces of\n  code.\n- Improved atf-report's CSV output format to include information about\n  test programs too.\n- Fixed the tests that used atf-compile to not require this tool as a\n  helper.  Avoids systems without build-time utilities to skip many tests\n  that could otherwise be run.  (E.g. NetBSD without the comp.tgz set\n  installed.)\n- Many general cleanups: Fixed many pieces of code marked as ugly and/or\n  incomplete.\n"

These include those grammars that define how\n  the different components communicate with each other as well as the\n  format of files written by the developers and users: the Atffiles and the\n  configuration files.\n- Added the atf-version tool, a utility that displays information about\n  the currently installed version of ATF.\n- Test cases can now define an optional cleanup routine to undo their\n  actions regardless of their exit status.\n- atf-report now summarizes the list of failed (bogus) test programs\n  when using the ticker output format.\n- Test programs now capture some termination signals and clean up any\n  temporary files before exiting the program.\n- Multiple bug fixes and improvements all around.\n"
